Exploring the world of fandom offers a unique opportunity to understand the mechanisms at work in the cultural landscape, both online and offline. The modern world is characterised by constant connectivity and communication, facilitated by the rapid advancement of digital technology in society. This transformation is redefining the cultural landscape and supporting the development of digital fan cultures that not only consume content, but actively create and share it. This paper examines digital fandom communities from a historical perspective. The research takes an interdisciplinary approach and uses qualitative and quantitative research methods to trace the development of fandom platforms on the web. Based on the analysis of digital resources, including web-archived websites, it examines how fandoms function as digital communities and how their culture has changed over time. The article offers insights into the evolution of fandom culture from the 1990s to 2020, taking into account English-speaking fandom platforms preserved in the Open Doors project and Russian-speaking platforms selected as a case study. The article concludes with the need for comprehensive preservation of born-digital cultural heritage, which is in danger of being lost for various reasons, including political, cultural and technical.
